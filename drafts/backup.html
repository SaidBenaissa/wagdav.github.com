</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>At work, I stored all my important data on the lab's server which
(obviously) was backed up once a day.  At home, on my personal laptop I
haven't had a systematic backup solution.  Now I'm changing this.</p>
<div class="section" id="everyday-backup-with-obnam">
<h2>Everyday backup with Obnam</h2>
<p>I decided that I will backup my laptop's important data on my home
file-server.  It's a <a class="reference external" href="http://sharecenter.dlink.com/products/DNS-320">DNS-320 ShareCenter</a> with 2x1TB disk in RAID 1.
Naturally, this won't save me in case of theft or fire in my house, but I
will deal with the off-site backup problem later, when a local backup
problem is solved.</p>
<p>For my backups I use <a class="reference external" href="http://liw.fi/obnam">Obnam</a>.  My configuration file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.obnam.conf</span></tt> is
qute simple:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[config]
repository = /media/nas/backup
log = /home/dwagner/.obnam/obnam.log
exclude = /home/dwagner/temp, /home/dwagner/pictures
</pre>
<p>I exclude the temporary files in my home directory because it just contains
all kinds of junk I don't really care loosing.  I also don't backup this way
the <tt class="docutils literal">pictures</tt> directory, since I secure my photos in there differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="photo-backup-with-git-annex">
<h2>Photo backup with git-annex</h2>
<p>I store my personal photo collection in a <a class="reference external" href="http://git-annex.branchable.com">git-annex</a> repository.  I have
at least two copies of all the pictures (one on the file server and one on a
USB HDD dedicated for this purpose).  A copy of the recent photos, usually
the current year's are on my laptop as well.  I noticed that these are the
pictures I access the most frequently, mainly showing them to friends and
family.  If I need to go back earlier in time, I can have those photos from
home in a day (or when I go home), but not instantly from my laptop.  This
works for me, because the SSD on my laptop is not that spacious, and I don't
want to store all my photos on it.</p>
<p>When I download new pictures from my camera I do <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git-annex</span> sync</tt> across
the picture repositories making sure that my precious memories are well
preserved.</p>
