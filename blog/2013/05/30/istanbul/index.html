        <p><em>Disclaimer: We were (fortunately) not involved in the recent events on the
Taksim-square.  The clashes between the protesters and the police started
the day after we left Istanbul.</em></p>
<p>Following a log of the summer vacation in Turkey between 25 May - 8 June
2013.</p>
<div class="section" id="day-1-arrival">
<h2>Day 1: Arrival</h2>
<p>On the airport it was already clear that some people in this country are not
really strong at queueing.  Without any attempt to generalise a guy and two
families who cut in front of us have all Uzbek passports, it seems that's
the way they roll there.</p>
<p>We took the Havataş-bus from the airport.  The bus stop was not that easy to
find in the jungle of taxis and other buses, but soon we were on our way
towards the city.</p>
<p>The bus stopped dropped us off at <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Square">Taksim-square</a>.  The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nicoleport.com/">Nicoleport</a> hotel is
only 15 minutes walk from there.  A march of (peaceful) protesters crossed
our way at Taksim.  Since we don't speak Turkish we did not understand what
their message was.</p>
<p>After an hour of nap, we started our tour around the city.  We discovered
the hotel's broad neighbourhood: the main shopping/promenade district,
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0stiklal_Avenue">İstiklal Street</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galata_Tower">Galata Tower</a>, etc.  We mainly followed the
recommendation of the two Istanbul travel books we have: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.routard.com/guide/code_dest/istanbul.htm">Le guide du
routard</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://lonelyplanet.com">Lonely Planet</a>.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the city shops of a certain kind are found in
clusters.  We passed through a quarter of Antiquarians, but we also saw many
shops for power tools, carpets, etc. very close to each other.</p>

<img alt="|filename|/images/turkey/IMG_6392.JPG" class="align-center" src="http://thewagner.net/static/images/turkey/IMG_6392.JPG" style="width: 50%;" />
<p>For the honor of our Dutch friends we visited the Dutch embassy and we also
found the Italian one.</p>
<p>It is impossible to miss the numerous cats all around the city.  As the
travel book puts it, they are no one's and fed by everyone.  Indeed, we
noticed many cat feeding/drinking stations, possibly made by shop owners,
out of some plywood and PET bottles.  Cats, of course, know very well that
the best treats can be found near restaurants with lots of tourists.</p>
<img alt="|filename|/images/turkey/IMG_6458.JPG" class="align-center" src="http://thewagner.net/static/images/turkey/IMG_6458.JPG" style="width: 50%;" />
<p>In the evening we noticed the heavy presence of the police's riot squad:
shields, masks, everything.  We did not experience anything from the events
in the park near the Taksim square (we did not even go to that park there at
all).  In fact, we only understood what was happening after we left
Istanbul.</p>
<p>First impression of the city: chaotic but charming.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-2-sultanahmet">
<h2>Day 2: Sultanahmet</h2>
<p>We spend the day visiting places in the must-see category:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Palace_Mosaic_Museum">Mosaic Museum</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippodrome_of_Constantinople">Hippodrome</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Ahmed_Mosque">Blue Mosque</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Hagia_Sophia">Little Hagia Sophia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are all incredibly beautiful.  The big disappointment of the day,
however,  is the Hippodrome.  If you've ever been to the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus">Circus Maximus</a>
in Rome, you know what I'm talking about.  Catchy name, but nothing to see.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Palace_Mosaic_Museum">Mosaic Museum</a> may not be as known than the others above (less
tourists!), but it has a breathtaking collection of mosaics from the
Byzantine period.</p>
<img alt="|filename|/images/turkey/IMG_6450.JPG" class="align-center" src="http://thewagner.net/static/images/turkey/IMG_6450.JPG" style="width: 50%;" />
<p>After the museums we walked a bit on the seashore where there's a wagon at
every 100m or so selling green apples and salty gurkins as refreshment.  We
had dinner in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pasazade.com/">Paşazade</a> and returned to the hotel.</p>
<p>When we woke up in the morning, we found a nice market straight in front of
the hotel.  Below you can see what's left from it by the end of the day.
The cleaning staff worked hard overnight and the next morning the street was
clean again.</p>
<img alt="|filename|/images/turkey/IMG_6407.JPG" class="align-left" src="http://thewagner.net/static/images/turkey/IMG_6407.JPG" style="width: 47%;" />
<img alt="|filename|/images/turkey/IMG_6519.JPG" class="align-right" src="http://thewagner.net/static/images/turkey/IMG_6519.JPG" style="width: 47%;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-3-more-sultanahmet">
<h2>Day 3: More Sultanahmet</h2>
<p>After buying breakfast at one of the stands in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emin%C3%B6n%C3%BC">Eminönü</a>, we continue
exploring the old Istanbul:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topkapi_palace">Topkapı Palace</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BCleymaniye_Mosque">Süleymaniye Mosque</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bazaar,_Istanbul">Grand Bazaar</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly others had similar plans too:</p>
<img alt="|filename|/images/turkey/IMG_6543.JPG" class="align-left" src="http://thewagner.net/static/images/turkey/IMG_6543.JPG" style="width: 50%;" />
<p>The lesson of the day is that the Grand Bazaar is <em>really</em> big.  Moreover,
if I say</p>
<blockquote>
,,Gimme that map, I'll show you the way out!''</blockquote>
<p>I lie.  Its shops are not worth mentioning, but its sheer size and
architecture makes it really unique in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-4-fatih">
<h2>Day 4: Fatih</h2>
<p>We started the day in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chora_Church">Chora Church</a> then walked through the quarter
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatih">Fatih</a> to reach the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_Archaeology_Museums">Istanbul Archeological Museums</a>.  Probably the best
way to get closer to the city is to go one or two streets farther from the
touristic places.  The environment changes drastically: smaller (and poorer)
streets, more people in traditional outfit doing their everyday stuff.</p>
<p>Navigation is challenging not only in the Grand Bazaar but also in the small
streets around it.  We spent quite a bit of time wandering around to find
the Book Market.  We did succeed but when we got there the were closing
already.  Bummer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-5-ortakoy">
<h2>Day 5: Ortaköy</h2>
<p>After visiting the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmabah%C3%A7e_Palace">Dolmebahçe Palace</a> we spent some time in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortak%C3%B6y">Ortaköy</a>
harbor eating Turkish ravioli and ice cream.  Then back to Sultanahmet to
see the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_Cistern">Basilica Cistern</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-6-leaving-istanbul">
<h2>Day 6: Leaving Istanbul</h2>
<img alt="|filename|/images/turkey/IMG_6496.JPG" class="align-center" src="http://thewagner.net/static/images/turkey/IMG_6496.JPG" style="width: 50%;" />
<p>We took the Havataş again to the airport and had a very expensive lunch at
the airport.  Then at 14:00 off we go to Izmir, where the holiday <a class="reference external" href="http://thewagner.net/blog/2013/06/02/guezelcamli/">continues</a>.</p>
